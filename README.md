# Code-of-conduct
Calgary Sfotware Crafters events are safe and inclusive environments for everyone to hang and chat about tech. We require all participants to treat others with respect and refrain from any form of harassment. People who fail to treat others accordingly will be asked to leave our events. Please contact an organizer if you have any concerns.
